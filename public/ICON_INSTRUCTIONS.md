# PWA Icon Instructions

## Required Icons

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create two icon files:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## How to Create Icons

1. Use the Fountain Vitality logo or create icons based on your brand
2. Ensure icons are square (same width and height)
3. Icons should have transparent or solid backgrounds
4. Place icons in the `/public` folder

## Quick Icon Generation

You can use online tools like:

1. Opening the site in Chrome/Edge
2. Clicking the install prompt (if available)
3. Or going to Settings > Install App

The app should now be installable on mobile and desktop devices!
